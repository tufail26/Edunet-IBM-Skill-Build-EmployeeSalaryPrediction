## ⚡ **What I Built**

An end-to-end **Streamlit-based ML application** featuring:

* 🔍 **Real-time salary prediction** using multiple ML models
* 🧼 **Complete data preprocessing** pipeline (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
* 📈 **Model evaluation:** R², RMSE, MAE, CV scores
* 🗓 **Trend analysis** based on date/time features
* 📊 **Box plots, Violin plots, Outlier detection**
* 🧪 **Statistical testing** (T-tests, correlation heatmaps)
* 📅 **PDF report generation** with predicted results

---

## 🤖 **Machine Learning Models Used**

* **Linear Regression**
* **Random Forest Regressor**
* **XGBoost Regressor**
* **GridSearchCV** (for model tuning)
* **K-Fold Cross Validation** (for robustness)
